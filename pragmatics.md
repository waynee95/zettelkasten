# Programming Language Pragmatics

- Programming languages consist of syntax, semantics and _pragmatics_
- Pragmatics describes ergonomic (usability) and technical aspects of the language:
  - What kind of optimizations does the compiler do?
  - What target languages are supported (e.g. X86, ARM, $\dots$)? Is there are VM?
  - How does the garbage collector work?
  - How well-developed is the standard library?
  - Does the language offer a package manager?
  - Does the language has editor support (syntax highlighting, LSP)?
  - Does the language have an automatic code formatter?
