# Accepter vs Transducer

- **Accepter:** An automaton whose output is limited to "yes" or "no". An accepter either accepts or rejects a string
- **Transducer:** An automaton that can produce a string as output, i.e. Mealy or Moore machines
- A turing machine can act as an accepter, as well as a transducer
