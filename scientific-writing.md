# Scientific Writing

## Rules of Thumb

- Use simple sentences
  - Avoid long convoluted phrases that distract from the point
- Be consistent in your writing style
- Never say "for various reasons"
  - Tell the reader the reasons!

## Citations

- A citation is an _annotation_ for a sentence
  - It is not part of the sentence and should play no grammatical role in the sentence
  - If you remove the citation, the sentence should still be grammatically correct and complete
- Always check if all citations are complete and consistent
  - Do not just copy-paste Bibtex entries from the web and call it a day. They might be incorrect!

## Structure

- **Paper Title**
  - Should summarize the hypothesis of the paper
  - The reader should be able to work out what the paper is about from the title alone
- **Abstract**
  - State the problem, your approach and solution and main contributions of the paper
  - Include little if any background and motivation
  - The content in the abstract should not be repeated later word for word in the paper
  - Most readers will not read beyond the abstract, so be sure to include the key points you want casual readers to take with them
- **Introduction/Motivation**
  - Motivate the contribution of the paper and to place it in context
  - Ends with a short summary of the rest of the paper
- **Related Work/Literature Survey/Background**
  - This section could be covered in the beginning or at the end
- **Body**
  - Theory
  - Specification
  - Implementation
  - Evaluation
- **Further Work**
- **Conclusions**
  - A short summarizing paragraph
  - Should not repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction
- **Acknowledgments**
- **References**
- **(Appendix)**
