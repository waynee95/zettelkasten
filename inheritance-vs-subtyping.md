# Inheritance vs Subtyping

- Inheritance goes together with subtyping
  - But they are orthogonal ideas
  - Inheritance relationship between two classes does not imply subtype relationship
- Subtyping is a relation between _(object) types_
  - Object (types) refer to the interface (which methods are available)
  - Subtyping is interface sharing
  - A type `B` is a _subtype_ of `A` if every function that can be invoked on an object of type `A` can also be invoked on an object of type `B`
- Inheritance is a relation between _classes_
  - Classes refer to the implementation
  - Inheritance is code sharing
  - A type `B` _inherits_ from another type `A` if some functions for `B` are written in terms of functions of `A`
- Connection: A subclass generates objects whose type is a subtype of the objects generated by a superclass
