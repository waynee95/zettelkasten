# Necessary vs Sufficient Conditions

- Necessary condition = A condition $A$ is said to be _necessary_ for a condition $B$, iff the falsity of $A$, guarantees the falsity of $B$
  - "Air is necessary for human life"
  - "Without air, human beings do not live"
  - "If a human is alive, then that human has air to breathe"
    - In an if-then statement, the clause that follows "then" (consequent) states the necessary condition for the antecedent (clause followed by "if")
  - A necessary condition is not a _sufficient condition_
  - All sorts of conditions may be _necessary_ for others, but do not (by themselves) suffice or guarantee those others
- Sufficient condition = A condition $A$ is said to be _sufficient_ for a condition $B$, iff the truth of $A$ guarantees the truth of $B$
  - While air is a necessary condition for human life, it is not a sufficient condition, i.e. it does not, by itself, guarantee human life
    - There are many necessary conditions for human life
  - "Having four sides" is a necessary condition for a square, but that single condition by itself is not sufficient for something to be a square
    - Some four sided things are not squares
