# Normalization by Evaluation

- Evaluation = Compute the _value_ of closed expressions (no free variables)
  - E.g. evaluation of arithmetic expressions in primary school: $(11 + 9) \times (2 + 4) = 120$
- Normalization = Bring expressions with unknowns into a canonical form
  - E.g. simplification in secondary school: $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$
- Normalization of Evaluation (NBE) = Adaption of an interpreter to simplify expressions containing unknowns
