# "Up to"

- A figure of speech used in mathematics in connection with expressions derived from equality
  - E.g. uniqueness or count
  - "$x$ is _unique up to_ $R$" means that all objects $x$ under consideration are in the same equivalence class with respect to the relation $R$
  - "Prime factorization of an integer is unique up to ordering"
    - This means that two lists of prime factors are equivalent because we can obtain one from the other by reordering the list
- With equivalence relations we can ignore subtleties
  - "up to ordering" means "ignoring the particular ordering"
- Some other common examples include:
  - "up to isomorphism"
  - "up to permutations"
  - "up to rotations"
- Informally, the word modulo is used for similar purposes, e.g. "modulo isomorphism"
