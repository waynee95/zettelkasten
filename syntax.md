# Syntax

- Every programming languages has _syntax_ and _semantics_

## Syntax

- Syntax = Form of programs (how programs are written)
- Syntax affects how a programmer writes and reads programs and how programs are parsed
- Formalized by a formal grammar or syntax diagrams

## Semantics

- Semantics = Meaning of programs
- Semantics affect how programs are composed together, understood and interpreted by a computer
- Often not formally specified; there is not one universal formalism
