# Three Address Code

- TAC/3AC = Three Address Code
- Is an intermediate representation where each TAC instruction has _at most_
  three operands
    - Each instruction is typically a combination of assignment and binary operation
    - For example `t1 := t2 + t3`
- Since it is an IR, it uses _symbolic_ addresses (virtual registers)
- A refinement of TAC is A-normal form (ANF)
